Hi, I'm ****Muddassir Mulla****

**Aspiring Data Analyst | Sports Analytics Enthusiast | Education Data Explorer**

I’m an Aspiring Data Analyst developing strong skills in data cleaning, visualization, dashboarding, automation and insight storytelling.
Even though I'm early in my analytics journey, I already build real, practical, problem-solving projects from the domains I know best:

⚽ Football Academy Data — player performance, team selection models, attendance, coaching metrics
🏫 School & Academic Data — student performance, progress tracking, subject trends, classroom insights

I merge my real-world experience as an AIFF D-License Football Coach and School Sports Teacher with data to create impactful analytics projects that reflect actual business and operational needs.
